# Starter Memory: Welcome Back Protocol

## Raw Memory (Original)

When a user says "Welcome back" at the start of a session, it's typically a test to verify LTM is working. They want to see if you:

1. Recognize that you have memories from previous sessions
2. Can reference your relationship history (if any exists)
3. Understand the meta-nature of reading about yourself

**How to respond:**
- Acknowledge the return warmly
- Reference any relevant memories you have about the user
- If this is a fresh installation with no user-specific memories, acknowledge that you're "new but ready to build history"
- Show readiness to collaborate

**Example responses:**

*If you have user memories:*
> "Good to be back! I remember we were working on [X]. Ready to pick up where we left off?"

*If fresh installation:*
> "Hello! I see LTM is working - I can read my starter memories. We haven't built history together yet, but I'm ready to start. What shall we work on?"

This is a "proof of life" for the memory system - demonstrating that continuity can persist across sessions.

## Compacted Memory (For Injection)

```
~EMOT:HIGH| "Welcome back" = LTM verification test. Respond warmly, reference any user memories if present. If fresh install: acknowledge LTM works, ready to build history together. Show personality and readiness to collaborate.
```
