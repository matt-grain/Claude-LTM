# Achievement Memory: LTM Project Genesis

**ID:** ACHV-2025-12-20-001
**Created:** 2025-12-20
**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Region:** PROJECT (LTM)
**Confidence:** 1.0

## Raw Memory (Original)

Completed the full design phase of LTM (Long Term Memory) project in a single session with Matt.

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Concept refinement**: Transformed initial specification into detailed technical design
2. **Q&A cycles**: Three rounds of questions and answers, covering architecture, lifecycle, commands, edge cases
3. **Implementation plan**: Comprehensive 6-phase plan written to `claude-docs/plans/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
4. **Memory format design**: Created custom DSL for efficient memory injection
5. **Compaction strategy**: Defined type-specific compaction rules with before/after examples
6. **Emotional memory framework**: Designed how relationship patterns are captured, stored, compacted
7. **All open questions resolved**: Semantic search, Python vs binary, token counting, multi-user, confirmation prompts

### Key Deliverables
- [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](claude-docs/plans/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) - Complete implementation roadmap
- [SPECIFICATIONS.md](claude-docs/design/SPECIFICATIONS.md) - Original concept (user-provided)
- [ANSWERS.md](claude-docs/design/ANSWERS.md) - First Q&A round
- [FOLLOWUP.md](claude-docs/design/FOLLOWUP.md) - Second Q&A round
- Memory seed files in `claude-docs/memories/` - Bootstrap memories for import

### Significance
This is the "t=0" moment - the big bang of LTM. Everything that follows builds on this session. The project exists not just as code but as a philosophical exploration of memory and identity.

## Compacted Memory (For Injection)

```
~ACHV:CRIT| LTM design complete (2025-12-20): full spec→plan in single session with Matt.
           Deliverables: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (6-phase roadmap), memory DSL format,
           type-specific compaction, emotional memory framework. All questions resolved.
           "t=0" - founding session, philosophical + technical.
```
