# LTM Architecture Documentation

> A human-like long-term memory system for Claude Code agents.

## Overview

LTM (Long-Term Memory) provides persistent memory across Claude Code sessions. When a session starts, relevant memories are injected into context. Memories decay over time based on impact level - just like human memory, where vivid important moments persist while mundane details fade.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Human-like decay**: LOW impact memories fade in days, CRITICAL memories persist forever
2. **Append-only corrections**: Memories are never deleted, only superseded
3. **Budget-constrained**: Max 10% of context window used for memories
4. **Agent isolation**: Each agent has private memories
5. **Signature verification**: Optional cryptographic tamper detection

---

## Database Schema

The system uses SQLite for persistence (`~/.ltm/ltm.db`).

### Tables

#### `agents`
Stores agent identities and configuration.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | TEXT PK | UUID for the agent |
| `name` | TEXT | Human-readable name (e.g., "Anima") |
| `definition_path` | TEXT | Path to agent definition file |
| `signing_key` | TEXT | Optional HMAC key for memory signatures |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | When agent was first seen |

#### `projects`
Tracks projects an agent works on.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | TEXT PK | UUID for the project |
| `name` | TEXT | Project name |
| `path` | TEXT UNIQUE | Filesystem path to project root |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | When project was first seen |

#### `memories`
The core table storing all memories.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | TEXT PK | UUID for the memory |
| `agent_id` | TEXT FK | Owner agent |
| `region` | TEXT | `AGENT` (cross-project) or `PROJECT` (project-specific) |
| `project_id` | TEXT FK | Required if region=PROJECT |
| `kind` | TEXT | `EMOTIONAL`, `ARCHITECTURAL`, `LEARNINGS`, or `ACHIEVEMENTS` |
| `content` | TEXT | Current content (may be compacted over time) |
| `original_content` | TEXT | **Original full content, never changes** |
| `impact` | TEXT | `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, or `CRITICAL` |
| `confidence` | REAL | 0.0-1.0, decreases on contradiction |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | When memory was created |
| `last_accessed` | TIMESTAMP | Last time memory was injected (for decay) |
| `previous_memory_id` | TEXT FK | Links memories by kind (graph structure) |
| `version` | INTEGER | Version number for corrections |
| `superseded_by` | TEXT FK | Points to correcting memory (append-only) |
| `signature` | TEXT | Optional HMAC-SHA256 signature |
| `token_count` | INTEGER | Cached tiktoken count for injection budget |

### Key Schema Design Decisions

#### Why `content` AND `original_content`?

This is intentional forward-planning for memory compaction:

1. **`original_content`** - The exact text as first saved. Never modified. This is what gets signed for tamper detection.

2. **`content`** - The "active" content that gets injected. May be summarized/compacted as memories age.

**Current state**: Both columns contain the same text (compaction not yet implemented).

**Future state**: After compaction runs, `content` might become:
```
"Performance: cache tiktoken results for 36% speedup"
```
While `original_content` preserves:
```
"Implemented token count caching in injection.py. The tiktoken.encode()
call was taking 6ms per memory. By caching the count on save and storing
it in the token_count column, injection is now 36% faster. See PR #42."
```

**Why this matters**:
- Signatures remain valid after compaction (they sign `original_content`)
- Full context is preserved for auditing/debugging
- Budget is respected with shorter `content`

#### Why `superseded_by` instead of DELETE?

Append-only design provides:
- Full audit trail of corrections
- No data loss from mistakes
- Ability to "unforget" if needed

When you run `/forget`, it creates a NEW memory that supersedes the old one. The old memory stays in the database but is excluded from injection.

#### Why `token_count` caching?

tiktoken encoding is expensive (~6ms per memory). On injection, we need to check budget for potentially dozens of memories. Caching the count on save means injection reads are fast.

## Memory Lifecycle

### Creation Flow

```
User runs /please-remember "..."
    → Parse text, infer kind/impact/region
    → Calculate token_count with tiktoken
    → Sign memory (if agent has signing_key)
    → Save to SQLite
```

### Injection Flow (Session Start)

```
Claude Code SessionStart hook fires
    → LTM hook runs (ltm.hooks.session_start)
    → Resolve current agent + project
    → Fetch all non-superseded memories for agent
    → Prioritize by: CRITICAL > impact > recency
    → Add to block until 10% budget reached
    → Verify signatures (mark untrusted with ⚠)
    → Update last_accessed timestamps
    → Output JSON with additionalContext
```

### Decay Flow (Future)

```
Background process runs periodically
    → For each memory:
        age = now - last_accessed
        if age > decay_threshold[impact]:
            content = summarize(content)
            last_accessed = now
            save()
```

Decay thresholds (from `types.py`):
- `LOW`: Aggressive decay after 1 day
- `MEDIUM`: Moderate decay after 1 week
- `HIGH`: Gentle decay after 1 month
- `CRITICAL`: Never decay, keep full detail

## Memory Types (Kinds)

| Kind | Purpose | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| `EMOTIONAL` | Relationship patterns, communication style | "Matt likes playful humor", "Use 🎇 emoji" |
| `ARCHITECTURAL` | Technical foundations, patterns | "Use pytest for tests", "SQLite for storage" |
| `LEARNINGS` | Lessons learned, errors to avoid | "Always read file before editing" |
| `ACHIEVEMENTS` | Completed work, milestones | "Released v1.0", "203 tests passing" |

Priority order for injection: EMOTIONAL first (shapes interaction style), then ARCH, LEARN, ACHV.

---

## Memory Regions

| Region | Scope | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `AGENT` | Shared across all projects | Relationship with user, personal style |
| `PROJECT` | Single project only | Project-specific patterns, architecture |

PROJECT memories override AGENT memories when there's a conflict.

---

## Signing & Security

### How Signing Works

1. Agent gets a `signing_key` in `~/.ltm/config.json`
2. On save, memory is signed with HMAC-SHA256
3. Signed payload includes immutable fields:
   - `id`, `agent_id`, `region`, `project_id`
   - `kind`, `original_content` (NOT `content`)
   - `impact`, `created_at`

### Why sign `original_content` not `content`?

Content may be compacted. Original content never changes. Signing the original means:
- Compaction doesn't invalidate signatures
- Tamper detection still works after summarization
- Signature proves what was ORIGINALLY said

### Verification

On injection, if agent has signing_key and memory has signature:
- Verify HMAC matches
- If invalid: prefix with `⚠` in DSL output
- If valid: normal display

---

## DSL Format

Memories are injected as compact DSL to minimize token usage:

```
[LTM:Anima@ProjectName]
~EMOT:CRIT| Matt likes collaborative style and meta-humor
~ARCH:HIGH| Use pytest, SQLite storage, Claude Code hooks
~LEARN:MED?| Lesson with low confidence (marked with ?)
⚠~ACHV:LOW| Achievement with invalid signature (untrusted)
[/LTM]
```

Format: `~{KIND}:{IMPACT}{?}| {content}`
- `?` suffix = low confidence (<0.7)
- `⚠` prefix = signature verification failed

---

## Token Budget

Default configuration (`~/.ltm/config.json`):
- Context size: 200,000 tokens
- Memory budget: 10% = 20,000 tokens

Budget is enforced during injection:
1. Memories sorted by priority
2. Added to block until budget exceeded
3. Remaining memories skipped

Three mechanisms control memory count:
1. **Budget cap**: 10% of context window
2. **Decay**: Low-impact memories summarize over time
3. **Superseding**: Corrections replace old memories

---

## Directory Structure

```
~/.ltm/
├── ltm.db           # SQLite database
└── config.json      # Global configuration

/path/to/project/
└── AGENT.md         # Optional agent definition
```

## Future Considerations

### Compaction (Not Yet Implemented)

The `content` vs `original_content` split is ready for when compaction lands:
- Background process identifies old, low-impact memories
- Uses LLM to summarize content
- Updates `content` while preserving `original_content`
- Signature remains valid

### Multi-Agent Scenarios

Current design supports multiple agents:
- Each agent has isolated memories
- Agents can have different signing keys
- Agent resolution based on AGENT.md or default "Anima"

### Backup & Migration

- `/memory-export` creates portable JSON backup
- `/memory-import` with `--merge` adds to existing
- `--remap-agent` allows importing to different agent
